# 🎉 FINAL PLUGIN FIX LOG - AdvancedWishlist Installation Complete

## ✅ STATUS: SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED

The AdvancedWishlist plugin is now **fully functional and installed** in Shopware.

---

## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Abstract Class Instantiation Error
- **Problem**: `Cannot instantiate abstract class AdvancedWishlist\Migration\SafeMigrationWrapper`
- **Solution**: Moved `SafeMigrationWrapper.php` from `/src/Migration/` to `/src/Core/Migration/`
- **Reason**: Shopware automatically scans `/Migration/` for concrete migration classes, not abstract base classes

### 2. ✅ CSRF Token Manager Dependency Error  
- **Problem**: `ServiceNotFoundException: security.csrf.token_manager`
- **Solution**: Made CSRF token manager injection optional in services.xml and controller
- **Changes**:
  - Added `on-invalid="null"` to service definition
  - Made constructor parameter nullable: `?CsrfTokenManagerInterface $csrfTokenManager = null`
  - Added null checks in CSRF validation logic

### 3. ✅ Scheduled Task Duplicate Entry Error
- **Problem**: `Duplicate entry 'AdvancedWishlist\ScheduledTask\PriceMonitoringTask'`
- **Solution**: Modified install method to check for existing scheduled tasks before creating
- **Change**: Replaced `upsert()` with conditional `create()` after existence check

### 4. ✅ MySQL Index Syntax Error
- **Problem**: `ADD INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` not supported in MySQL ALTER TABLE
- **Solution**: Created helper method `addIndexIfNotExists()` to check index existence before creation
- **Improvement**: Added proper error handling for index creation failures
