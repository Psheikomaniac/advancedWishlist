# Security Fixes Implemented

## Overview
This document outlines the security fixes implemented as part of Phase 1, Step 2 of the AdvancedWishlist plugin roadmap. The changes address critical security vulnerabilities identified in the security-considerations.md file.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Authorization Checks
Added proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access, update, and delete their own wishlists:

- **Detail Endpoint**: Added checks to verify if the wishlist belongs to the current customer, is public, or is shared with the customer.
- **Update Endpoint**: Added checks to ensure only the owner can update the wishlist.
- **Delete Endpoint**: Added checks to ensure only the owner can delete the wishlist and that the target wishlist (if transferring items) also belongs to the customer.

### 2. CSRF Protection
Added CSRF protection to all state-changing operations:

- **Create Endpoint**: Added CSRF token validation.
- **Update Endpoint**: Added CSRF token validation.
- **Delete Endpoint**: Added CSRF token validation.

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization
Implemented input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS and other injection attacks:

- **Create Endpoint**: 
  - Added validation for required fields (name)
  - Added sanitization for name and description using htmlspecialchars
  - Added validation for name length and wishlist type
  - Removed potentially dangerous fields from input data

- **Update Endpoint**:
  - Removed potentially dangerous fields from input data
  - Added sanitization for user input

### 4. Error Handling
Improved error handling to provide appropriate error responses without exposing sensitive information:

- Added try-catch blocks to handle exceptions
- Added specific error codes and messages for different error scenarios
- Used appropriate HTTP status codes for different error types

## Implementation Details

### WishlistController Changes
1. Added CSRF token manager dependency
2. Updated all endpoints to include proper authorization checks
3. Added input validation and sanitization
4. Improved error handling

## Remaining Security Issues
The following security issues from the security-considerations.md file still need to be addressed:

1. **SQL Injection Risks**: Need to ensure all database queries use parameterized queries.
2. **Permission Framework**: Need to implement a comprehensive permission framework for wishlist access control.
3. **Security Headers**: Need to implement security headers middleware.
4. **Audit Logging**: Need to implement audit logging for wishlist operations.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the missing service implementations (WishlistValidator, WishlistLimitService, WishlistCacheService) as part of Phase 1, Step 3.
2. Address the remaining security issues in future phases of the roadmap.
