- [ ] Set up Redis caching

### 4. Testing Expansion (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Implement fixtures
- [ ] Create test utilities
- [ ] Achieve 50% test coverage

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-8)

### 1. Modern PHP Features (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Implement PHP 8.3 features:
  - [ ] Typed class constants
  - [ ] #[\Override] attributes
  - [ ] json_validate() function
- [ ] Implement PHP 8.4 features:
  - [ ] Property hooks
  - [ ] Asymmetric visibility
  - [ ] New array functions
  - [ ] New without parentheses

### 2. Symfony 7 Best Practices (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Implement MapRequestPayload for DTOs

- [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage

## Phase 4: Production Readiness (Weeks 9-12)

### 1. Security Hardening (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Add OAuth2 for API access
- [ ] Set up security monitoring
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing

### 2. Documentation (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met

## Conclusion
This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing the AdvancedWishlist plugin. By following this plan, the development team can address the most critical issues first while systematically improving the codebase. The estimated timeline for full implementation is 12 weeks, with the most critical issues resolved within the first 2-4 weeks.
