# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the AdvancedWishlist plugin as part of Phase 2, Step 3 of the roadmap.

## Overview

The following performance optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Query Result Caching**: Caching of expensive database queries to reduce database load
2. **Pagination**: Support for paginating large result sets to reduce memory usage and improve response times
3. **Field Filtering**: Support for requesting only specific fields to reduce data transfer and processing
4. **Redis Caching**: Integration with Redis for distributed caching to improve cache hit rates and performance

## Query Result Caching

Query result caching has been implemented in the `WishlistCrudService` to cache the results of expensive database queries. This reduces database load and improves response times for frequently accessed data.

### Implementation

- The `getWishlists` method in `WishlistCrudService` now uses the `WishlistCacheService` to cache query results
- Cache keys are generated based on the customer ID and a hash of the criteria object
- Cache invalidation is handled automatically when wishlists are created, updated, or deleted

### Example

```php
// Results will be cached based on customerId and criteria
$wishlists = $this->wishlistCrudService->getWishlists($customerId, $criteria, $context);
```

## Pagination

Pagination has been implemented to support efficient retrieval of large result sets. This reduces memory usage and improves response times for endpoints that return collections.

### Implementation

- The `getWishlists` method in `WishlistCrudService` now supports pagination through the Criteria object
- The `list` method in `WishlistController` extracts pagination parameters from the request and applies them to the Criteria object
- Pagination information is included in the response, including the current page, total pages, and limit

### API Usage

```
GET /store-api/wishlist?page=1&limit=10
```

Response:
```json
{
  "total": 25,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 10,
  "pages": 3,
  "wishlists": [...]
}
```

## Field Filtering

Field filtering has been implemented to allow clients to request only the specific fields they need. This reduces data transfer and processing, improving response times.

### Implementation

- The `getWishlists` method in `WishlistCrudService` now supports field filtering through the Criteria object
- The `list` method in `WishlistController` extracts field filtering parameters from the request and applies them to the Criteria object
- Special handling for nested fields like 'items.count' has been implemented

### API Usage

```
GET /store-api/wishlist?fields=id,name,itemCount
```

Response:
```json
{
  "total": 25,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 10,
  "pages": 3,
  "wishlists": [
    {
      "id": "1234",
      "name": "My Wishlist",
      "itemCount": 5
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Redis Caching

Redis caching has been implemented to provide a distributed caching solution. This improves cache hit rates and performance, especially in multi-server environments.

### Implementation

- A new `RedisCacheAdapter` class has been created to integrate with Redis
- The `WishlistCacheService` now uses the `RedisCacheAdapter` instead of the default cache service
- The Redis connection is configured through the `REDIS_URL` environment variable
- Tag-based cache invalidation is supported for efficient cache invalidation

### Configuration

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```
###> advanced-wishlist/redis-cache ###
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
###< advanced-wishlist/redis-cache ###
```

## Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring has been added to track the execution time of key operations. This helps identify performance bottlenecks and measure the impact of optimizations.

### Implementation

- The `getWishlists` method in `WishlistCrudService` now logs performance metrics for the total execution time, search time, and transform time
- Performance metrics are logged at the INFO level with context information

### Example Log

```
[2023-07-09 12:00:00] app.INFO: Wishlists retrieved {"customerId":"1234","count":10,"performance":{"totalTimeMs":25.5,"searchTimeMs":15.2,"transformTimeMs":5.3}}
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Cache Warming**: Implement cache warming for frequently accessed data
2. **Query Optimization**: Further optimize database queries based on real-world usage patterns
3. **Async Processing**: Move expensive operations to background jobs
4. **HTTP Cache Headers**: Add HTTP cache headers for public resources
